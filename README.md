# rock-paper-scissors
This is a project that is split into two parts: one for the functionality of the popular game rock paper scissors in the developer console and another with a fully fledged user interface on the website itself. As the first JavaScript project of The Odin Project, this is to test my knowledge of functions, problem solving, pseudocode, and the various fundamental types and syntax that one needs to know about JavaScript in order to gain the fundamental knowledge for more complex and bigger websites.

By the end of the project, I hope to be able to get a solid grasp on JavaScript fundamentals which I will be using later on to create a basic website that will be able to prove my knowledge of the fundamentals. While I have done this course and other programming endeavors before, I am still relearning what I have put aside and this is just the beginning to my dedicated and successful programming career (hopefully...).


getComputerChoice function pseudocode
Computer gets a random choice between rock, paper, or scissors when function is called:
Call math random between number 1 to 3
If number is 1
  return "rock"
Else if number is 2
  return "paper"
Else if number is 3
  return "scissor"
Else
  log that something is wrong (only 3 numbers should be returned from math random)
